# StegHide
encrypt message into images. 

currently listed as Open-gl (Open good luck) it will work but u need to install the dependencies 
-suggested ask chat gpt if any error messages durring first build up.
-then re-run the code in python IDLE for each useage


one good and or different thing about this steg-hide is it does not reveal the message by saving the data to a seperate vulnerability file on the pc. it pops up in a window and then goes away after.
traditionally a separate file will "appear" in the directory which can kinda get nicked out, now no file will exists
